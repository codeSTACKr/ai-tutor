Technical Demo Take-Home Assignment:
Building with Claude
Introduction
This take-home assignment is designed to assess your skills in creating compelling
technical content, building practical demonstrations, and your ability to inspire
developers to build with Claude. You will be creating a technical demonstration that
showcases Claude's capabilities in a way that makes other developers think "I need
to try this."
Your task is to create a runnable technical demonstration that:
● Showcases Claude's capabilities in an innovative or powerful way
● Provides clear, executable code that developers can learn from
● Makes complex AI capabilities accessible and exciting
● Demonstrates your ability to identify what resonates with developer
audiences
We expect this assignment to take 4-6 hours to complete. If you decide to put in
more time, please clearly note the content that was created before the 4-6 hour
mark.
Note: Please document your use of Claude (including prompts and workflows) as
this demonstrates your ability to effectively use AI tools in creating developer
resources.

Your Assignment
Create a technical demonstration that would make other builders excited to try
Claude. This should be a runnable web application or a Jupyter/Colab notebook
that combines:

● Working Code: A fully functional implementation that developers can run
and modify
● Technical Depth: Demonstrates sophisticated use of Claude's capabilities
● Clear Narrative: Guides developers through the concepts with excellent
documentation
● Practical Value: Solves a real problem or enables something genuinely useful
Suggested Approaches (Choose One)
While you have creative freedom, here are some directions you might consider:
● Novel Integration: Combine Claude with other developer tools (databases,
frameworks, APIs) in unexpected ways
● Agentic Architectures: Leverage Claude’s tool use and instruction following
abilities to build an innovative agentic application
● Advanced Techniques: Demonstrate sophisticated prompting patterns, tool
use, or multi-step workflows
● Domain-Specific Application: Show how Claude excels in a particular
technical domain (code analysis, data processing, etc.)
● Developer Workflow Enhancement: Build something that genuinely
improves how developers work
● Creative Technical Use Case: Surprise us with an application we haven't seen
before
Technical Requirements
Your demonstration must include:
● Runnable Code: Jupyter/Colab notebook or web equivalent interactive
format
● Clear Setup Instructions: Including API key management, dependencies, and
environment setup
● Well-Documented Code: Inline comments explaining key concepts and
decisions
● Thoughtfully Written Code: Demonstrate production-ready practices
Submission Guidelines

Submit your work as an organized repository or folder structure including:
● The Demo: Your main technical demonstration
● README.md that includes:
○ Quick overview of what your demo does and why it's compelling
○ Setup and running instructions
○ Technical approach and key architectural decisions
○ Why you chose this particular demonstration
○ How this helps developers understand Claude's potential
○ What would make other builders want to learn more
○ How you used Claude in creating this demo (prompts, iterations,
insights)
○ What you would add or improve given more time
● Video - include a short screencast of your demo and any interesting insights
you’d like to share
● Any Supporting Files: Additional code, data files, or resources needed
Evaluation Criteria
We're looking for:
● Technical Excellence: Clean, well-structured code that demonstrates best
practices
● Innovation: Fresh approaches that showcase Claude in new or powerful ways
● Developer Empathy: Clear understanding of what excites and motivates
developers
● Educational Value: Code and documentation that teaches while it
demonstrates
● Practical Impact: Demonstrations that solve real problems or enable new
possibilities
● Communication: Clear narrative that makes complex concepts accessible
Tips for Success
● Focus on the "wow" factor - what will make developers immediately want to
try this?

● Balance sophistication with accessibility - advanced techniques explained
clearly
● Show, don't just tell - let the code and outputs speak for themselves
● Think about your audience - what problems do developers face that Claude
can solve?
● Don't just replicate existing tutorials - bring your unique perspective

Remember: We're not looking for a standard tutorial. We want to see your creativity
in demonstrating what's possible with Claude in a way that genuinely excites other
developers. Show us something that would make you excited to build if you saw it
in the wild.
